Project Title: Customer Loyalty Management System

Description:
The Customer Loyalty Management System is a full-stack web application built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and jQuery. This system enables businesses to manage customer registrations, record transactions, and track loyalty information effectively. The backend server is developed with Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful API endpoints for handling customer registration, transaction recording, and loyalty information retrieval. Sequelize is used as an ORM to interact with a MySQL database, ensuring efficient database operations and data integrity. On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and jQuery are utilized to create an intuitive user interface for registering customers, recording transactions, and displaying loyalty information. The project showcases proficiency in full-stack web development, including backend server setup, database integration, RESTful API design, frontend development, and data validation. It demonstrates effective use of environment variables for sensitive data, thorough testing, and error handling. Potential future improvements include implementing user authentication, enhancing error handling, optimizing frontend responsiveness, and deploying the application to a production environment.
